# fgmod2md
A set of XSL Templates to give a headstart on formatting Fantasy Grounds db.xml content for Homebrewery markdown.

## Why?
Because I wrote a really cool Fantasy Grounds module and I love pretty formatting from Homebrewery.

So, I take the `db.xml` file from the FG module export and run it through the XSL transformer to get something that's a good start on the Markdown I want.

## So far, so good
* NPCs are mostly there.
